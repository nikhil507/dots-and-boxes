# dots-and-boxes

AI based game

To compile this program just do `make` in terminal, then `a.out` or `a.exe` will be produced, then run it 
with `./a.out` or `./a.exe`, to work on this, we will input 3 numbers, `x y a`
`x` and `y` tell the coordinate on which we have to place a line, `a` tells on the box which line is to be made, if `a` is 0,
then top line of the box, if its 1 then right line, if its 2 then bottom line if its 4 then left line.
After your move the computer will take its turn, after that you will move.
